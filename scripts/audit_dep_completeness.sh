# audit_dep_completeness.sh — Per-Package .dep File Completeness Audit
#
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PURPOSE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# In SONiC's DPKG caching system (Makefile.cache), each package has a .dep file
# (rules/<pkg>.dep) that declares what inputs affect its cache key. If a .dep file
# is incomplete — missing a build flag, a source file pattern, or a dependency —
# the cache key won't change when it should, and stale artifacts will be served.
#
# This script performs static analysis across ALL rules/*.dep files to identify
# gaps where build inputs exist in .mk files but are not reflected in cache key
# computation. It cross-references:
#   - rules/*.mk  (what flags/deps/sources actually affect each package)
#   - rules/*.dep (what the cache system tracks)
#   - Makefile.cache (global lists and hash computation logic)
#   - Source directories (whether packages have source code at all)
#
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# WHAT IT CHECKS (9 checks)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# Check 1: Packages registered in build categories without a .dep file
#           These packages have NO cache key computation at all — they'll always
#           get a cache hit on first write, regardless of source changes.
#
# Check 2: .dep files that don't include their own .mk file in DEP_FILES
#           The .mk file defines dependencies and build flags — if it changes
#           (e.g., new _DEPENDS added), the cache key must reflect that.
#
# Check 3: Build flags (ifeq/ifneq conditionals) in .mk not tracked in .dep
#           Analyzes WHAT each conditional does to distinguish:
#           - Build-affecting: changes _DEPENDS, _RDEPENDS, build commands → REAL gap
#           - Assembly-only: changes SONIC_INSTALL_DOCKER_IMAGES → safe to ignore
#
# Check 4: _DEPENDS declared in .mk but not reflected in .dep DEP_FILES
#           If package A depends on package B, A's cache key should include B.
#
# Check 5: Source directory patterns — .dep declares _SRC_PATH or git ls-files
#           but the pattern may miss files (e.g., generated sources, submodules).
#
# Check 6: CACHE_MODE consistency — GIT_COMMIT_SHA vs GIT_CONTENT_SHA
#           GIT_COMMIT_SHA mode uses the git commit hash (fast but coarse).
#           GIT_CONTENT_SHA hashes actual file content (precise but slower).
#
# Check 7: Cross-package dependency completeness — are transitive deps covered?
#           If A depends on B depends on C, does A's cache key transitively
#           include C's changes? (Makefile.cache handles this via DEP_MOD_SHA
#           recursion, but only if B is declared as a dep of A.)
#
# Check 8: slave.mk flags used in package build rules but not tracked
#           Scans for flags like SONIC_BUILD_JOBS, ENABLE_SYNCD_RPC that are
#           used in conditionals but not in SONIC_COMMON_FLAGS_LIST or DEP_FLAGS.
#
# Check 9: Nested derived packages not covered by cache save/restore
#           add_derived_package(X, Y) only adds Y to X's first-level
#           _DERIVED_DEBS, and the cache save does not recurse. If X is itself a
#           derived deb, Y is dropped from the top-level package's cache tarball.
#           Confirmed by negative control NC-6 (libnl3 nested derived debs).
#
# Check 10: Exported build-env flags not tracked in any cache key
#           Flags passed via `export FLAG` (not an ifeq($(FLAG)) conditional) are
#           consumed inside debian/rules or sub-Makefiles, so the ifeq-based
#           Checks 3 and 8 cannot see them. Closes the "export-only" blind spot
#           (e.g. ENABLE_FRR_TCMALLOC on frr, whose _DEP_FLAGS is common-only).
#
# ── The following checks close blind spots an independent multi-model LLM audit
#    found that the flag-oriented checks above cannot model (file / dep-edge /
#    non-determinism classes). Each is data-driven and evidence-gated. ──
#
# Check 11: Build flags consumed ONLY inside a package's source recipe
#           (debian/rules, source Makefile, setup.py) but absent from _DEP_FLAGS.
#           Checks 3/8 only read .mk ifeq blocks and slave.mk; a flag read straight
#           from the environment inside the submodule recipe (e.g. ENABLE_ASAN in
#           sonic-sairedis/debian/rules, ENABLE_GCOV in sonic-swss) is invisible to
#           them, so toggling it silently reuses a stale artifact.
#
# Check 12: In-repo Jinja2 templates a Dockerfile.j2 {% include/import/from %}s
#           but the image's .dep does not track. dockers/dockerfile-macros.j2 is
#           imported by ~50 images yet lives outside each image's $(DPATH) glob, so
#           editing the shared macro invalidates almost no image cache.
#
# Check 13: Package built from a real source tree (_SRC_PATH set) with caching ON
#           but whose .dep hashes NO source at all (no _SMDEP_FILES and no
#           `git ls-files` of the source) — the entire source is outside the key
#           (e.g. bmcweb / sonic-dbus-bridge in rules/sonic-redfish.dep).
#
# Check 14: Moving-ref / non-deterministic fetch behind a stable cache key —
#           raw/master|main URLs, :latest base images, unpinned `go get`, meson
#           wrap revision=HEAD/main. The artifact changes upstream while the key
#           does not, so a stale build is reused (e.g. gobgp `go get`).
#
# Check 15: Structural DEP_FILES bugs that silently drop source from the key:
#           (a) aliasing another package's SPATH-derived DEP_FILES so the package's
#               OWN source is never hashed (sflowtool/psample, libnss-radius);
#           (b) `SPATH := $(PKG)_SRC_PATH` missing the inner `$(...)` so the glob
#               resolves to nothing (platform/mellanox/rshim.dep);
#           (c) a second `DEP_FILES :=` (colon-equals, not `+=`) that discards the
#               already-accumulated common/rule files (rules/eventd.dep).
#
# ── Checks 16–17 extend the same "recipe consumes an input outside the key"
#    principle to the two build targets whose inputs are NOT declared in a
#    rules/*.dep at all (so Checks 1–15 never look at them): the host
#    root-filesystem image, and the shared docker build-context tooling. ──
#
# Check 16: Host root-filesystem (SONIC_RFS_TARGETS) files consumed by
#           build_debian.sh (or a script it invokes) but absent from the
#           hand-maintained RFS_DEP_FILES list in Makefile.cache. The rootfs key
#           is GIT_CONTENT_SHA over RFS_DEP_FILES, yet build_debian.sh sources
#           functions.sh, copies files/scripts/*, renders extra
#           files/build_templates/*.j2, and runs several scripts/*.{sh,py} — none
#           tracked, so editing them reuses a stale squashfs. Data-driven: parses
#           the actual RFS_DEP_FILES globs and the actual recipe's file reads.
#
# Check 17: Docker build-context generators consumed by EVERY docker image build
#           but hashed into NO docker cache key. slave.mk runs
#           scripts/prepare_docker_buildinfo.sh, which invokes
#           scripts/versions_manager.py / docker_version_control.sh and copies
#           src/sonic-build-hooks/buildinfo/* into the context. None are in
#           SONIC_COMMON_FILES_LIST (only .platform rules/functions Makefile.cache)
#           nor under any image's $(DPATH), so editing them silently reuses stale
#           images. (The version OUTPUT under files/build/versions/** IS folded in
#           at Makefile.cache; only the generator logic is untracked.)
#
# ── Check 19 closes a further "consumed input outside the key" gap that an
#    independent multi-model audit surfaced after Checks 16–17. ──
#
# Check 18: (invariant verifier — NOT a gap) Docker _INSTALL_PYTHON_WHEELS /
#           _INSTALL_DEBS packages are NOT baked into the image, so Makefile.cache's
#           docker dependency-SHA rollup (GET_MOD_DEP_SHA -> MOD_DEP_PKGS) correctly
#           omits them. A multi-model review (opus/gpt/gemini, unanimous) plus direct
#           tracing established: slave.mk's docker recipe lists _INSTALL_* only as
#           "%-install" PREREQUISITES (slave.mk ~L1237-1238); those %-install rules
#           run `dpkg -i` / `pip install` on the build HOST, never inside the image.
#           The image content is produced solely from the j2 vars _debs/_whls/_pydebs,
#           which derive strictly from _DEPENDS/_RDEPENDS, _PYTHON_WHEELS and
#           _PYTHON_DEBS (slave.mk ~L1263-1265) — _INSTALL_* is never referenced by
#           any Dockerfile.j2 (proof: docker-gnmi-sidecar declares both _INSTALL_*
#           lists yet its Dockerfile installs zero packages). Their real purpose is
#           host-side provisioning for the build-time cli-plugin-tests pytest run
#           (slave.mk ~L1270). Folding them into the docker key (as an earlier draft
#           proposed) would only OVER-invalidate the image cache for zero correctness
#           gain. This check therefore verifies the host-only invariant and flags ONLY
#           the genuine defect: an _INSTALL_* package that IS also baked into the image
#           (appears in an image-content role) yet is somehow not folded — a condition
#           that does not currently occur.
#
# Check 19: An online-deb target that reuses another target's HTTP header
#           fingerprint (wget --spider --server-response, used to defeat a moving
#           upstream softlink) in its _DEP_FLAGS while its OWN artifact URL is
#           never spidered — so its real moving remote identity is not in the key
#           (e.g. BRCM_DNX_SAI reuses the XGS-derived SAI_FLAGS). Data-driven:
#           parses the spidered URL set and the consuming targets from the recipe.
#
# ── Check 20 closes the "in-repo patch content applied before the build but not
#    folded into the artifact's cache key" class (two mechanisms). ──
#
# Check 20A (quilt patch series): slave.mk applies $(pkg)_SRC_PATH).patch/series
#           to a source-built package via 'QUILT_PATCHES=... quilt push -a' right
#           before dpkg-buildpackage / make / wheel builds. When the source root
#           is a submodule, the sibling <root>.patch/ dir lives in the PARENT
#           repo, so _SMDEP_FILES (which runs 'git ls-files' INSIDE the submodule)
#           can never see it, and no _DEP_FILES enumerates it — editing a patch
#           reuses a stale cached deb (e.g. src/sonic-swss.patch, ptf, scapy,
#           supervisor, redis-dump-load, sonic-dash-ha, ptf-py3). Coverage is
#           decided empirically per patch dir: a series is covered iff some
#           resolved source root T satisfies 'git -C T ls-files <rel>' (which,
#           for a submodule root, excludes a parent-repo sibling) — so nested
#           patch dirs under a normal (non-submodule) root (p4lang/*, thrift_0_14_1)
#           are correctly NOT flagged. Evidence-gated on the slave.mk quilt recipe.
#
# Check 20B (external kernel patches): a platform overrides EXTERNAL_KERNEL_PATCH_LOC
#           (e.g. platform/mellanox/non-upstream-patches/); src/sonic-linux-kernel/
#           Makefile copies + applies that dir's *.patch when INCLUDE_EXTERNAL_PATCHES=y,
#           but the linux-kernel cache key folds only the INCLUDE_EXTERNAL_PATCHES
#           *flag* in _DEP_FLAGS — never the tracked patch content — so editing the
#           patch while the flag stays 'y' reuses a stale cached kernel. Evidence-
#           gated on the linux-kernel recipe consuming EXTERNAL_KERNEL_PATCH_LOC.
#
# ── Check 21 closes the "inline (non-export) env VALUE consumed by a cached recipe
#    but absent from the key" class that Check 10 (exported-only) is blind to. ──
#
# Check 21: slave.mk's rootfs (RFS) recipe invokes ./build_debian.sh with a long
#           prefix of INLINE, per-command environment assignments
#           (VAR=$(VAR) ./build_debian.sh) instead of `export`ed variables.
#           build_debian.sh reads those VALUES and bakes them into the rootfs that
#           the recipe then SAVE_CACHEs, yet the RFS target's cache key folds only
#           SONIC_COMMON_FLAGS_LIST. Because Check 10 scans EXPORTED variables only,
#           these inline values are a structural blind spot — e.g. the default admin
#           USERNAME/PASSWORD, CHANGE_DEFAULT_PASSWORD, the BMC account credentials,
#           MASTER_KUBERNETES_VERSION and MASTER_CRI_DOCKERD, IMAGE_TYPE, DBGOPT:
#           changing any of them bakes new content into the rootfs while the same
#           stale cached squashfs is restored. Data-driven: parse the inline env
#           prefix of every SAVE_CACHE-backed ./build_debian.sh recipe, keep only the
#           vars build_debian.sh actually reads, then drop those already in the key,
#           those exported (deferred to Check 10), and those human-waived. Identity /
#           plumbing values ($* target-stem name, its derived TARGET_MACHINE, the
#           TARGET_PATH output dir, SONIC_VERSION_CACHE) are cleared via reasoned
#           waivers in scripts/cache_key_export_waivers.tsv; everything else is
#           default-deny (P1).
#
# ── Checks 25–26 close the two remaining "build-environment identity not in the
#    key" classes: the slave.mk recipe body, and the slave/toolchain image. ──
#
# Check 25: slave.mk is intentionally NOT hashed into any DEP_FILES list; instead a
#           MANUAL version stamp, SONIC_CACHE_RECIPE_VER, is folded into every key via
#           SONIC_COMMON_FLAGS_LIST, and a git-object baseline (SONIC_CACHE_RECIPE_VER_
#           BASELINE) records the slave.mk content it was last reviewed against. Two
#           ways this silently fails: (a) the stamp is removed from SONIC_COMMON_FLAGS_
#           LIST — then no key tracks the recipe body at all; (b) slave.mk drifts from
#           the baseline without the stamp being bumped — packages built with the old
#           recipe are served stale. Data-driven: parse the stamp membership and
#           compare git hash-object slave.mk to the recorded baseline.
#
# Check 26: package keys capture the slave build environment only through the
#           sonic-slave-<distro> Dockerfile SOURCE (SONIC_COMMON_BASE_FILES_LIST).
#           The identity of the BUILT slave image (SLAVE_TAG / the resolved base-image
#           digest / the apt package versions installed into it) is in NO package key,
#           so a toolchain change that does not edit the Dockerfile source — a moving
#           base tag, an upstream apt update — reuses stale cached packages. Reports
#           the structural omission (no slave-image identity token in the common key)
#           and, as evidence, each sonic-slave base image pinned by a moving tag.
#
# Check 27: output-affecting GLOBAL build-mode selectors that are not encoded in the
#           output filename and not one of CONFIGURED_PLATFORM/CONFIGURED_ARCH/BLDENV
#           (which ARE in SONIC_COMMON_FLAGS_LIST). CROSS_BUILD_ENVIRON gates the
#           CROSS_COMPILE_FLAGS in the dpkg-buildpackage recipe, so a native vs cross
#           build of the SAME arch produces different binaries under the same key. If
#           such a selector is used by a build recipe but is absent from SONIC_COMMON_
#           FLAGS_LIST, the two builds collide on one cache entry. This is the residual
#           of the variant/mode-collision class NOT already covered by CONFIGURED_*.
#
# Check 28: helper scripts invoked by slave.mk build recipes (scripts/*, src/sonic-
#           build-hooks/*) that shape the CONTENT of produced artifacts — buildinfo /
#           version-pin / debug-file injection into images — but are not in SONIC_
#           COMMON_FILES_LIST nor any _DEP_FILES. Editing such a script changes every
#           affected output without moving any cache key. Data-driven: enumerate the
#           scripts referenced in recipes and verify each is hashed by a file list.
#
# Check 29: embed-without-edge. A package's debian/rules extracts a SIBLING built deb
#           (dpkg -x of target/debs/<env>/<name>_*.deb) and copies content out of it,
#           yet declares no _DEPENDS edge on <name>. The embedded binary is baked into
#           the package but rebuilding <name> does not invalidate this package's key,
#           so it is served stale. Data-driven: map each embedding debian/rules back to
#           its owning rules .mk (via _SRC_PATH), and flag every embedded sibling whose
#           name is absent from the aggregated _DEPENDS/_RDEPENDS of that package.

# INTERPRETING RESULTS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# Findings are classified by severity:
#
#   P0 = Confirmed stale cache risk
#        The gap WILL cause incorrect cache hits under normal usage.
#        Example: A package has no .dep file at all.
#
#   P1 = Likely stale cache risk (needs verification)
#        Strong evidence of a gap, but needs Phase 2 PoC to confirm binary diff.
#        Example: ENABLE_SYNCD_RPC changes build profile but isn't in syncd.dep.
#
#   P2 = Potential risk / cosmetic concern
#        May or may not cause issues depending on usage patterns.
#        Example: A .dep doesn't include its own .mk file (redundant if .mk
#        rarely changes build output independently of source).
#
#   P3 = Informational / design observation
#        Not a bug, but worth knowing for completeness.
#        Example: Deprecated flag still tracked in some .dep files.
#
# The summary table at the end shows counts by severity. Focus on P0/P1 first.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = No P0 findings (P1 warnings may exist but are not blocking)
#   1 = P0 findings present (confirmed stale cache risk). In --base mode this
#       includes ANY finding the PR introduces (a finding absent at the
#       merge-base) as well as Check 10 exported-variable gaps the PR touches.
#   2 = Script error (e.g., not run from repo root, missing Makefile.cache)
#
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# FALSE POSITIVE FILTERING
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# The script includes filters to reduce noise from known non-issues:
#
# - Assembly-only flags: INCLUDE_* flags that only control whether a Docker image
#   is INSTALLED into the final NOS image (SONIC_INSTALL_DOCKER_IMAGES) — they
#   don't change what's INSIDE the image during build.
#
# - Block-content analysis (data-driven, no hand-maintained flag lists): the script
#   inspects WHAT a conditional block DOES rather than matching flag names. A block is
#   "build-affecting" only if it touches a stable SONiC build variable (see
#   BUILD_SIGNAL_RE: *_DEPENDS/_RDEPENDS/_DBG_PACKAGES/_EXTRA_DEBS/_DERIVED_DEBS/
#   _SRC_PATH/_BUILD_ENV/_MAKE_ENV/_CFLAGS/_MAKE_TARGET, add_derived_package /
#   add_extra_package, dpkg-buildpackage, DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS). Blocks that only select/assemble packages (SONIC_MAKE_DEBS,
#   SONIC_INSTALL_DOCKER_IMAGES, SONIC_PACKAGES_LOCAL, DEFAULT_FEATURE_STATE/OWNER)
#   carry no build signal and are classified assembly-only (not a gap). These naming
#   conventions are fixed by Makefile.cache/slave.mk, so the audit needs no upkeep as
#   new feature flags are added.
#
# - Deprecated flags: detected generically — any flag pinned to 'n' for the modern
#   build envs (an if(n)eq filter on $(BLDENV) naming bookworm/trixie that sets the
#   flag = n in slave.mk) is reported as P3 informational only.

# input the PR changes whose change the relevant cache key does not capture (a NEW

# P0 iff its provenance intersects that set (see provenance_in_diff).
#
# This replaces the old "materialize the merge-base in a second worktree, re-run
# the whole audit there, and subtract" approach, which was NON-DETERMINISTIC: the
# base worktree's submodule content could differ from HEAD's for reasons unrelated
# to the PR (partial local fetch, pin resolution, list ordering), so a pre-existing
# submodule-owned finding could look "new" and escalate to a spurious P0 in CI
# while passing locally. Changed-file scoping has no second audit to disagree with:
# same commit + same diff ⇒ same result on every run and machine.
#
# Submodule pin bumps: a gitlink change appears in the parent diff only as the
# submodule pointer. We expand it to the submodule's own inner changed files (old
# pin..new pin), path-prefixed, so a bump correctly counts its build inputs. If the
# pins aren't both present locally we conservatively mark the whole submodule path
# as changed (any provenance under it then matches) — still deterministic.

# --- Check 4: _DEPENDS declared in .mk vs what .dep tracks ---
# The .dep tracks file-level inputs. But _DEPENDS in .mk declares package-level deps.
# Those package deps are handled separately by Makefile.cache (via DEP_MOD_SHA).
# This check verifies that all _DEPENDS packages themselves have .dep files.
#
# Two classes of dependency are deliberately NOT flagged (they were previously
# reported but are false positives, confirmed by cache-mechanism review):
#   1. Docker-image dependencies. SONIC_DOCKER_IMAGES/*_DOCKERS targets are
#      content-keyed by their own mechanism (SHA_DEP_RULES folds
#      files/build/versions/** and _FILES into their DEP_FILES, and DEP_MOD_SHA
#      recursively folds their DEPENDS' hashes). They intentionally carry no
#      rules/*.dep, so "no .dep file" does not imply a stale cache key.
#   2. Dependencies whose defining .mk is already listed in the CONSUMER's own
#      .dep DEP_FILES. Editing that .mk (including a pinned vendor version bump)
#      already changes the consumer's cache key, so the dependency's missing
#      .dep is not a staleness gap for this consumer.
# The genuine gaps are from-source / version-pinned online libs (e.g. grpc,
# libsaithrift-dev, saiserver) with no .dep, embedded in a cacheable consumer
# that does not otherwise track them.

# Some build inputs never appear in an ifeq($(FLAG)) conditional; they are simply
# `export`ed from slave.mk / a rules/*.mk and consumed inside a package's
# debian/rules, source Makefile, or Dockerfile.j2 — or read straight from the
# environment by an external tool (docker, cargo, dpkg). Checks 3/8 only inspect
# ifeq/ifneq blocks, so such an export-only input that changes build output but is
# absent from SONIC_COMMON_FLAGS_LIST and every per-package *_DEP_FLAGS is invisible
# to them — flipping it silently reuses a stale cached artifact (the
# DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM class of bug).
#
# DESIGN: NO name heuristics, NO reliance on the Tier-2 rebuild, NO committed
# trust-store that can drift. scripts/cache_key_scan.py enumerates EVERY exported
# variable from live git-tracked source and classifies each by concrete evidence:
#   in-key    -> literally in SONIC_COMMON_FLAGS_LIST / a *_DEP_FLAGS. PROVABLY safe.
#   filename  -> value flows into a cached target's *.deb/*.whl/*.gz name. PROVABLY safe.
#   gap       -> referenced by a cached build recipe but untracked. REPORTED (P1).
#   assembly  -> referenced in the make/assembly layer, no cached-recipe consumer.
#                NOT provably safe (can still reach a cached `docker build`). REPORTED (P2).
#   external-env -> exported, NO in-repo consumer (read from the env by an external
#                tool). Cannot be proven safe by static analysis. REPORTED (P2).
# Only in-key/filename auto-clear (both recomputed live). Everything else is a
# finding (default-deny). A human clears a specific variable by recording it — WITH
# A REASON — in scripts/cache_key_export_waivers.tsv.
#
# PR/diff mode (--base REF): any not-provably-safe, un-waived export the PR TOUCHES
# is escalated to P0 (a hard gate) — this is exactly how DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM
# would be caught on the PR that introduces it. A full run (no --base) reports the

# --- Check 18: Docker _INSTALL_PYTHON_WHEELS/_INSTALL_DEBS host-only invariant ---
# CORRECTED (was a false positive): a docker's $(DOCKER)_INSTALL_PYTHON_WHEELS /
# _INSTALL_DEBS lists are NOT baked into the produced image, so Makefile.cache's docker
# dependency-SHA rollup (GET_MOD_DEP_SHA -> MOD_DEP_PKGS) is CORRECT to omit them.
# Ground truth (multi-model review + direct tracing, unanimous):
#   * slave.mk's docker recipe lists _INSTALL_* only as "%-install" PREREQUISITES
#     (slave.mk ~L1237-1238). Those %-install rules run `dpkg -i` / `pip install` on the
#     build HOST (slave.mk ~L940-960, ~L1076-1082), never inside the image.
#   * The image content is generated solely from the j2 export vars _debs/_whls/_pydebs,
#     which slave.mk populates strictly from _DEPENDS/_RDEPENDS, _PYTHON_WHEELS and
#     _PYTHON_DEBS (slave.mk ~L1263-1265). No Dockerfile.j2 ever references _INSTALL_*
#     (proof: docker-gnmi-sidecar declares both _INSTALL_* lists yet its Dockerfile
#     installs zero packages).
#   * Their real purpose is host-side provisioning for the build-time cli-plugin-tests
#     pytest run (slave.mk ~L1270). Folding them into the docker key would only
#     OVER-invalidate the image cache (busting e.g. every dhcp-relay/eventd/macsec image
#     on any sonic-utilities change) for zero correctness gain.
# This check therefore VERIFIES the host-only invariant. It stays silent in the normal
# case and re-activates real gap detection ONLY if slave.mk is ever changed so that the
# image-content j2 exports (_debs/_whls/_pydebs) start deriving from an _INSTALL_* list —
# at which point those packages genuinely enter the image and must be folded into the key.

# $(ENABLE_ASAN)), the transitive hash already separates the keys. This check is
